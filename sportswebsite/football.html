    <span class="border">The rules are designed to provide a compromise or combine between those of the two codes, with Gaelic football players being advantaged by the use of a 
	round ball and a rectangular field measured about 150 m (160 yards) long by 90 m (98 yards) wide (Australian rules uses an oval ball and field), while the Australian rules football 
	players benefit from the opportunity to tackle by grabbing between the shoulders and thighs and pulling to the ground, something banned in Gaelic football. The game also introduces 
	the concept of the mark, from Australian rules football, with a free kick awarded for a ball caught from a kick of over 15 metres (16 yd), where the kick must be in the forward direction if originating from a teammate.[2]</span><br>
